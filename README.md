# 🧠 AI Document Question Answering System (RAG)

A **local, privacy-first AI system** that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions grounded strictly in the document content using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

This project was built to deeply understand how **modern AI document assistants work internally**, not just to consume APIs.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Upload any **PDF document**
- Automatically:
  - Extract text from the PDF
  - Split it into overlapping chunks
  - Convert chunks into vector embeddings
  - Store embeddings in a **FAISS vector database**
- Ask natural language questions
- Receive **accurate, context-grounded answers**
- Runs **fully locally** using lightweight LLMs via **Ollama**
- Uses **document-level caching** to avoid repeated computation

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This is **not just a chatbot**.

It is a **real Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**, the same architecture used in:

- Enterprise document search
- Internal AI knowledge assistants
- AI copilots
- Research and legal document analysis tools

The project demonstrates:
- Understanding of **LLM limitations**
- How to **augment models with external knowledge**
- Efficient **vector search using FAISS**
- Performance optimization using **caching**
- Clean and modular system design

## 🧩 Key Design Decisions

### ✅ Chunking with Overlap
- Prevents loss of context
- Avoids broken sentences
- Improves embedding quality

### ✅ FAISS Vector Database
- Extremely fast similarity search
- Scales well to large documents
- Industry-standard vector search library

### ✅ Document-Based Caching
- Uses a hash of the PDF file
- Prevents re-chunking and re-embedding
- Makes repeated queries near-instant

### ✅ Local LLM Inference
- No API costs
- No data leakage
- Works offline
- Memory-aware model selection

### ✅ Grounded Answers Only
- If the answer is **not in the document**, the model responds:
  > "I don’t know"
- Prevents hallucinations

## 🖥️ User Interface

Built using **Streamlit**:
- PDF upload interface
- Question input field
- Answer display
- Expandable retrieved context section
- Optional evaluation/debug output

The UI is intentionally minimal and functional.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

###2️⃣ Start Ollama and Pull a Model
ollama pull tinyllama:1.1b
ollama run tinyllama:1.1b
(Model can be changed depending on available RAM)

3️⃣ Launch the App
streamlit run ui.py
Open your browser at:
http://localhost:8501
